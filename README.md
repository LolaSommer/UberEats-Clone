UberEats Clone

Training project: a clone of the UberEats food delivery service.
Hand-coded, prepared for future JavaScript interactivity.
live demo: 
https://lolasommer.github.io/UberEats-Clone/

Features:

Homepage with restaurant cards

Product menu

Responsive grid layout

Tech stack: HTML5, CSS3 (Flexbox, Grid), BEM.
Next steps: adding JavaScript for interactivity.
JavaScript features added:

✅ Dynamic cart popup — add/remove products, select quantity, automatic price calculation

✅ Modal windows:

Order info (product details)

Thank you message with total price

✅ Empty cart state and checkout button lock

✅ Full UI sync: all states (modals/cart/counter) work together without desync

✅ Persistent cart with localStorage

All logic is implemented in pure vanilla JavaScript without frameworks.
DOM manipulation, state updates, and dynamic rendering are handled manually.

📁 This marks the final step of this project.
Authorization and advanced routing intentionally skipped — core UI architecture and JavaScript logic are fully built and debugged.

⛓️ The repo is now stable and frozen.
